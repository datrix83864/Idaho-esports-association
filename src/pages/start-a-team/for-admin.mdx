## Welcome to the Idaho Esports Association

Your school is interested in competing in esports, now what? This page will help you get started with esports and if applicable the Idaho Esports Association. This guide can be used for most esports programs, even if they aren't located in Idaho.

## What is esports

In simple terms, esports is competitive gaming. It is a team of players competing against another team of players in a video game. Esports is a growing industry and is becoming more and more popular. It is also a great way to get students involved in school activities and to help them develop skills that will help them in the future.

### How it can help my school

This is yet another avenue students can be involved in their school. It can help students who may not be interested in traditional sports to be involved in a school activity. It can also help students develop skills that will help them in the future. These skills include:

- Teamwork
- Time management
- Communication
- Leadership
- Problem solving
- Critical thinking
- And many more

It has also been shown that students who are involved in school activities are more likely to graduate, have higher grades, and attend school more.

## What do I need to get started

### Hardware

Here is the first hurdle for administrators, teachers, and students: how are we competing? With what equipment? There are a few options for this, and each has its pros and cons.

1) Play from school
    - Pros
        - Students are already at school
        - Students are already on school computers
        - Students are already on school network
        - Students are already on school accounts
        - Students are already supervised
