## Welcome to the Idaho Esports Association

Your school is interested in competing in esports, now what? This page will help you get started with esports and if applicable the Idaho Esports Association. This guide can be used for most esports programs, even if they aren't located in Idaho.

## What is esports

In simple terms, esports is competitive gaming. It is a team of players competing against another team of players in a video game. Esports is a growing industry and is becoming more and more popular. It is also a great way to get students involved in school activities and to help them develop skills that will help them in the future.

### How it can help my school

This is yet another avenue students can be involved in their school. It can help students who may not be interested in traditional sports to be involved in a school activity. It can also help students develop skills that will help them in the future. These skills include:

- Teamwork
- Time management
- Communication
- Leadership
- Problem solving
- Critical thinking
- And many more

It has also been shown that students who are involved in school activities are more likely to graduate, have higher grades, and attend school more.

## What do I need to get started

### Where do we play from?

Here is the first hurdle for administrators, teachers, and students: how are we competing? With what equipment? There are a few options for this, and each has its pros and cons.

- Play from school
  - Pros
    - Students are at school, so no travelling home
    - School computers typically have some kind of monitoring software
    - Students are on school network
    - Students already have school accounts
    - Students are supervised
    - All students have access to the technology needed, not just those from more affluent families
  - Cons
    - Requires after school supervision duties from a staff member
    - IT Department will need to get involved because of the monitoring software
    - School computers may not be powerful enough, which means upgrades are needed or alternatively students will need to bring their own devices
- Play from home
  - Pros
    - Students typically already have the equipment necessary
    - No supervisory duties for staff
    - No IT Department involvement
    - No need for upgrades
  - Cons
    - Students are not supervised
    - Students are not on school network
    - The social aspect may be lost or less than an in-person team
    - Students who live a ways away from school may not be able to get home in time, or may not have the internet to be able to compete.

### How do we communicate during a match?

#### Internal Team Comms

For most games, there is a need for communication between team members. We recommend using [TeamSpeak](https://www.teamspeak.com/en/) for this. TeamSpeak by default allows 32 voice users at a time. Have more than 32 voice users at a time? Contact us at [support@idahoesports.gg](mailto:support@idahoesports.gg) and we will get you in contact with TeamSpeak, one of our sponsors, to look at getting you a license. The beauty of TeamSpeak over other options such as Discord, is that TeamSpeak can be used inside of your network with no external internet access necessary or for an external server, only a few specific IP addresses will need to be whitelisted. Students also don't need to make an account. This means that if you are playing from school, you can still use TeamSpeak without needing to worry about students having access to the internet or other chat lobbies like they would in Discord. We are also working on creating a TeamSpeak server for the Idaho Esports Association, so your school can use that if you would like, though this would require access through a firewall. Until the Association server is available, your IT department may need to get involved in creating a TeamSpeak Server for your school.

You may also consider [Discord](https://discord.com/). However, Discord is a web-based service, so it would require internet access, and unlike TeamSpeak, there is not a specific IP address for any server so full access would be necessary.

#### External Communication

For communication with other teams on gameday, teams will need access to idahoesports.leagueos.gg. This is where all matches are created and available. It would be best if your IT Department could simply whitelist *.leagueos.gg, where the * is a wild card, so that all subdomains are allowed. This will allow students to access the site without needing to worry about what subdomain they are on.

Our organization will on occasion send out emails to any email addresses associatied with the school or the players. So allowing emails from @idahoesports.gg and @leagueos.gg would be beneficial.
