## Who are we

We are a group of educators and administrators in the state of Idaho who are passionate about esports and the opportunities it provides for students. We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

## What do we do

We plan, organize, and run various esports opportunites across the state of Idaho in order to provide students with the opportunity to participate in esports in a safe and structured environment. We often partner with other organizations to provide these opportunities, such as Boise State University, the University of Idaho, and the Idaho Army National Guard. We provide these opportunites primarily to high school and middle school students.

## What does it cost

We understand that our main users are high school and middle school students, and that students often do not have a lot of disposable money. We strive to keep our costs as low as possible, however we do have to charge a small fee to cover our costs. We do offer scholarships to students and schools who are unable to pay the fees. With that in mind we only charge for starting players, not substitues or alternates. We also do not charge for coaches or other staff. For the 2023-2024 school year we are charging $10 per starting player per game.

This table will break down that cost per team. You can have as many teams as you can field but know that only one can make it to the state play-in event.

|Game|# of players|High School Cost|Middle School Cost|
|---|---|---|---|
|Rocket League| 3|$30|$15|
|Apex Legends| 3|$30|Not Offered|
|Mario Kart 8| 4|Not Offered|$20|
|Super Smash Bros Ultimate| 4|$40|$20|
|Valorant| 5|$50|$25|
|Overwatch 2|5|$50|$25|
|League of Legends|5|$25|$25|

## How do I get involved

If you are looking to start a high school or middle school esports group or if you have an esports group in the state of Idaho send us an email and we will respond as soon as we can. We are always looking for new schools and new students to join our organization. We are also looking for sponsors in order to help us keep our costs low, provide scholarships to students and schools who are unable to pay the fees, and build our organization to better help students and schools.
