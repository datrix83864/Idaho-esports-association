Several categories of documents that warrant special consideration are identified below.

##### Section 2 – Exception for Litigation Relevant Documents

Idaho Esports Association Inc expects all officers, and employees to comply fully with any published records retention or destruction policies and schedules, provided that all officers, and employees should note the following general exception to any stated destruction schedule: If you believe, or the Idaho Esports Association Inc informs you, that corporate records are relevant to litigation, or potential litigation (i.e. a dispute that could result in litigation), then you must preserve those records until it is determined that the records are no longer needed.
