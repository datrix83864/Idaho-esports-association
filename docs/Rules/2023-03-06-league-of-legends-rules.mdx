## 3. Tournament Rules 
### 3.1. Game Connections
All players taking part in IHSEA tournaments are required to have an active game account for the tournament they’re participating in. All game connection information shown on a team’s roster must match the accounts in the game. Players using different accounts or those not officially on the roster are prohibited from playing in matches. Only one account connection is allowed per game, the use of alternate accounts is prohibited. All account connections are prohibited from being changed after the team has participated in its first match of a tournament’s regular season.

If a player’s name does not match what is shown on their roster, please reach out to an IHSEA Administrator. Name discrepancy reports will not be accepted after a match has been completed. 
#### 3.1.1. Account Ownership
Game accounts used in official tournaments must belong to the student participating using that game connection. At no point in time may players share accounts with each other or use an account of another person, regardless of if they are in the tournament or not.
#### 3.1.2. School-Purchased Accounts
Schools may create accounts or purchase game licenses for their students participating in a tournament if they do not already have an active one. These accounts will be considered the students’ personal account and may only be used by one student each. These accounts and licenses may not be transferred to another student upon the previous student’s graduation or leaving the team, as this would be against any publisher’s Terms of Service or End User License Agreement.
### 3.2. Match Streaming
#### 3.2.1. Spectators
Spectators are permitted in game lobbies for the sole purpose of streaming their team’s match to the School’s Twitch or Youtube channel or to record the match. Spectators may not have any communication with team members while the game is currently being played and must not be a member of the roster participating in the match. At the end of the match, the stream vod or an unedited copy of the recording must be shared with the other team. 
#### 3.2.2. Player Streaming
Players may stream to their personal twitch or youtube channel if they are participating in the match. The match may only be streamed from the player’s in-game point of view and should have at least a 3-minute delay set to prevent possible incidents of stream sniping.

Players may not at any time stream another player or roster’s match on their personal channel.

#### 3.3.1. Unplayed Matches
Any match or queue that a team misses or does not complete will result in the match being counted as a loss against the team's record at the end of the regular season.
### 3.4. Playoff Qualification Tiebreakers
The tiebreaker system will be run as a tiered protocol that will be used if multiple teams finish the regular season with the same overall record. 

1. Wins. (Forfeit wins and bye wins are scored as a 0-0 win)
2. Head-to-head record. (If the two tied teams have played each other, their match record against each other is compared)
3. Overall game-win percentage. (e.g. winning a match 3-0 is better than 3-2)
4. Higher opponents’ game-win percentage. (e.g. it is better to beat an opponent who  consistently won 3-0 than 3-2)
5. Fewer forfeit losses.
6. Fewer bye wins.
7. The team who has a higher number of wins before their first loss.
If the first loss is received after the same number of wins, then the team which lost to the stronger opponent (as defined by game win percentage) will be ranked higher.

Any champions, skins, wards, ward skin, chromas, or other game content currently disabled in the Ranked or Normal game modes will be prohibited from use in official matches.
