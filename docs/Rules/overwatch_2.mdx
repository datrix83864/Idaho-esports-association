## 1. Match Overview

Supported platforms:

* PC

This game is cross-play. All players will face each other, regardless of console.

## 2. Game Lobby

You can see a video on how to create or join a lobby [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2ncKb2kHgw&list=PLfIm_36vd52y_6P_8yvSkcFMCIWHEx1rG&index=2).

The home team will create the lobby (a “non-player” pc should be used when available). The away team will determine red/blue. The lobby code will be required to use:

* VXH5C

### 2.1. Settings

* Modes: ALL
* Kill Cam Disabled Modes: ALL
* Game Mode Start: Manual
* Max Spectators: 3 (please note the 3rd spectator position is reserved for IEA Administrators)

In the event, an incorrect lobby code is loaded or the settings were changed, the match should be stopped and reset. Previously played maps with the incorrect format will not count toward the series. The author currently should be listed as “Datrix83864”.

## 8. Stoppage of Play

The game should automatically pause on a player disconnect.

* Shortly after a pause is initiated, a reason must be given via game chat (e.g.: player disconnect, ping issues, technical difficulties, etc.).
* Each team will have 5 cumulative minutes to pause. When 5 minutes have been exhausted, teams are required to continue play. Both teams should consider keeping track of time.
* Each team is responsible for timing their pause (any issues should be discussed with the other team and IEA Administrators)
* In the case of a player disconnect, after the 5 minutes are used, the team must continue the game (4 v 5)
* If the player is able to reconnect, the player can rejoin the match. It must be the same player with the same battle.net account in the same role.

## 9. Spectators

Each team is allowed 1 spectator, taking the spectator slot for the purpose of streaming the game to their school account (youtube, twitch, etc).

The spectator is not allowed to communicate with the team during the matches and are to only use their teams POV or similar.

Streams or recordings are to be shared with the opposing team when posted.

Coaching is only allowed between rounds.

Coaches are permitted to be un-deafened in voice chat, but mic must be software muted.

## 11. BM/Toxicity

* Our organization takes any forms of BM or toxicity seriously. Players should imagine that collegiate and professional recruiters may watch your game play at any time. Any form of BM or toxicity will not be tolerated and may result in warnings, player ban, team ban, and team removal from the season with no refunds. This includes but is not limited to:
  * Teabagging (crouching up and down on a downed opponent or objective point)
  * Body shooting (shooting a downed opponent where no prone ability is present)
  * Body or objective tagging (spraying a downed opponent or objective point)
  * Spamming voice lines
  * Cursing in game chat
  * Cursing in voice chat
  * Use of any slurs or derogatory language in game chat, LeagueOS chat, or any other form of communication

We are here to have fun and compete in a friendly environment. Please keep that in mind when playing in our league. While we understand that not all schools can stream or record, we do ask for some kind of evidence if a report is made. It is hard to take action without evidence to point to.
