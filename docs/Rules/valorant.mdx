## 1. Team

There are five members required for play with a maximum of five alternates.

### 1.1. Incomplete teams

A team may elect to start a game with fewer than 5 players on the map. They must complete the map before the missing player(s) can join. The team will play with a player down, no bots or random joins are permitted.

## 2. Lobby Settings

The Home Team (the team listed on left in the bracket) will create the match with the following settings:

* Spectators
  * Spectators should be in Coach’s Slot for matches to only spectate from their own team’s perspective
  * Spectators must be  the official twitch account and/or the approved coach account
* Mode: Standard
* Allow Cheats: Off
* Tournament Mode: On
* Overtime: Win By Two: On
* Play Out All Rounds: Off

## 3. Match Format

### 3.1. Map ban protocols

#### 3.1.1. Match regular season

##### 3.1.1.1 Map Pool (Based on Official Competitive Pool)

* Ascent
* Bind
* Breeze
* Haven
* Lotus
* Split
* Sunset

#### 3.1.2. Map Selection protocol

* Home bans the first map
* Away bans the second map
* Home picks from remaining list of maps
* Away chooses which side they want to start with (attack/defense)

#### 3.1.3. Tournament Map selection protocol

* After the first round, the losing team would get first map ban and can follow through the map selection protocol as Home, without the option to use the map just played. This leaves 6 maps from which to choose. E.G. the home team would be the losing team and the away team would be the winning team
* Teams are also allowed a 5 minute break and substitute players between matches, if desired.
* All teams are encouraged to complete all matches, but only 2 wins are required to report scores.
