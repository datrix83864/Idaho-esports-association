### 4.1. Game Connections

All teams taking part in the IEA Mario Kart 8 season are required to have a Nintendo Account for the tournament they’re participating in connected to their LeagueOS account in the form of a game connection; this should be connected to the coach’s LeagueOS account.

In the event that a team is playing from home, each player will be required to have their Nintendo Account connected to their individual LeagueOS profile. All game connection information shown on a team’s roster must match with the accounts in game. Players using different accounts or those not officially on the roster are prohibited from playing in matches. Only one account connection is allowed per game, the use of alternate accounts is prohibited. All account connections are prohibited from being changed after the team has participated in its first match of the regular season.

If a player’s name does not match what is shown on their roster, please reach out to an IEA Administrator through the LeagueOS match chat platform for assistance while the game is still being played. Name discrepancy reports will not be accepted after a match has been completed.

### 3.2. Match Streaming

A team may broadcast their matches online provided both teams have agreed to the broadcast, and all necessary permissions have been provided. It is up to each individual coach to communicate their team’s ability to participate in such a broadcast.

At the moment there is no ability for a third party to spectate private matches.

* Coaches may reschedule matches if circumstances prevent them from playing.
  * Both coaches must agree to a rescheduled match.
  * A date must be set at the time of the rescheduling. Failure to do so will result in a No Contest (0-0 tie) for the match.
  * Any rescheduled matches must be reported to an IEA Administrator within one (1) day of the original scheduled match.

### 3.4. Playoff Qualification Tiebreakers

The tiebreaker system will be run as a tiered protocol that will be used if multiple teams finish the regular season with the same overall record.

1. Wins. (Forfeit wins and bye wins are scored as a full series undefeated win)
2. Head-to-head record. (If the two tied teams have played each other, their match record against each other is compared)
3. Overall game win percentage. (e.g. winning a match 3-0 is better than 3-2)
4. Higher opponents’ game win percentage. (e.g. it is better to beat an opponent who consistently won 3-0 than 3-2)
5. Fewer forfeit losses.
6. Fewer bye wins.
7. The team which had a higher number of wins before their first loss.
8. If the first loss is received after the same number of wins, then the team which lost to the stronger opponent (as defined by game win percentage) will be ranked higher.

## 5. Restrictions

There are currently no restrictions in place.
