# Super Smash Bros. Ultimate 5-player Crew-Battle
*Verbiage*: For the purposes of this Rules Document, A “Match” is defined as the battle between the two schools, a “Set” is defined as one 5v5 Crew Battle, and “Game” is defined as a battle between two players. The winner is the school that drops their opponents final stock count to zero.
## 1. Anti-Cheat
No additional anti-cheat is required for official matches.
## 2. Match Procedure
- Matches are Best-of-2 during regular season
    - Ties are broken by:
         - If tied after 2 sets, the winner will be the team that had the most amount of stocks remaining. 
         - If tied on stocks remaining, the winner will be determined by a 1 v 1, 3 stock battle. Each team may elect who competes in their 1 v 1.
- Matches are Best-of-3 during tournaments
Standings will be determined by TOTAL STOCKS TAKEN IN A MATCH. With Win/Loss ratio acting as a tiebreaker

Communicate Arena names and password to the coach before the set begins. Max players are set to 4 to allow the 2 competing fighters and 1 spectator per school (for streaming purposes). Whenever possible, minimize the number of players in the arena to reduce lag.
### 2.3. Match Restrictions
- Amiibos are not allowed in competitive play, otherwise, all currently available DLC fighters are allowed except for Steve. In the event a new fighter is introduced mid season, the new fighter will not be allowed for a period of 2 weeks after the fighter is released.
- Mii Fighters ARE allowed in competitive play, but the moveset needs to be listed on the roster next to the player’s name who plans on using the Mii Fighter and communicated to the opposing team. Finally, before a game begins, the Mii player must demonstrate their moveset before play starts. When the demonstration is over, both players will “taunt” to indicate they are ready and then play can begin.
- Between sets coaching is allowed for up to two minutes - the use of a timer is encouraged.
- Players are encouraged to cheer and verbally support their team members, but may not coach during the set.
- Bad manners: Players who use excessive bad manners, insults, or such related behavior as determined by IHSEA administration will be subject to the IHSEA Code of Conduct and reviewed by league administrators to determine the consequences of such behavior.
- Hacking, Ghosting, Stream Cheating: Any type of use of an illegal 3rd party program or map hack, stream cheating, or other activity that leads to one player gaining an unfair advantage will follow the guidelines as laid out in the Expectations Documents, based on the offender.
- Due to the Steve tech issue we have banned Steve in all future events until such time as the tech is resolved.
### 2.4. Game and Match Flow
In Crew Battles, each school gets a total of 15 stocks (3 per player). On match day, the first thing schools will do is choose a map (Map banning rules are below). Then the player each school has appointed to the first slot will face off against each other in a three stock battle (full arena settings are below). The game is over when one player has eliminated all three stocks from the opposing player. The winning player then plays against the next player on the opposing schools roster.

However, at the start of the next game, the returning player must self-destruct (SDs) until their starting stocks are equal to the number of stocks they ended the previous game with. No damage may be inflicted by either player until the SDs have been completed. Players waiting on SDs may not use that time to charge specials or make any other move that will provide advantage - they should stand still.

The game begins when the invincibility wears off on the final entrance, both players are standing on their starting position, AND both players have “taunted” to indicate that they are ready. A player with a charged special is not ready even if they taunt.

The returning player MUST choose the same character for the next game.

IN THE EVENT THAT THE RETURNING PLAYER SDs TOO MANY TIMES, THE GAME STANDS AND PLAY BEGINS (unless BOTH coaches decide to remake).

Once a player is eliminated, the crew may choose ANY player that has not been eliminated to play next. This continues until all members of one Crew have been eliminated, this is the conclusion of the set.

At the conclusion of the first set, the stage for the next set is chosen.

A student may not exchange their character in between games, however, if they return for the next set, they may use a different character at that point.
