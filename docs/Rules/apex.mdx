## Definitions

* Match: 1 complete game
* Round: In game circle rounds.
* Series: All Matches

## Team

There are Three (3) players required for play with a maximum of Three (3) Alternatives.

### Incomplete teams

A team may elect to start a game with fewer than 3 players in the lobby. They must complete the round before the missing player(s) can join. The team will play with a player down, no bots or random joins are permitted.

## Competition Structure

### Team Distribution

At the beginning of the season, all Varsity teams will be distributed evenly into groups of 10 depending on total teams register. This is to ensure that each group will have at least 15 teams. Distribution will be based on previous seasons rank (in the event of no previous season rank, effected teams will be randomly distributed). Distribution will be as follows (Example of 40 competing teams):

| Group A | Group B | Group C | Group D |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1       | 2       | 3       | 4       |
| 5       | 6       | 7       | 8       |
| 9       | 10      | 11      | 12      |
| 13      | 14      | 15      | 16      |
| 17      | 18      | 19      | 20      |
| 21      | 22      | 23      | 24      |
| 25      | 26      | 27      | 28      |
| 29      | 30      | 31      | 32      |
| 33      | 34      | 35      | 36      |
| 37      | 38      | 39      | 40      |

### Matchups

Each Group will play each other in a round robin format during the season. The rotation will follow a structure similar to described:

* Week 1: A vs B, C vs D
* Week 2: A vs C, B vs D
* Week 3: A vs D, B vs C
* Week 4: A vs B, C vs D
* Week 5: A vs C, B vs D
* Week 6: A vs D, B vs C

### Scoring

The season will be a six (6) week long season with points from each week accumulating to determine playoff standing.

Scoring will determine standings for the State Qualifier.

Any additional tournament hosted during the regular season will not factor into the season point accumulation.

Point Values are as follows:

   | Placement | Point Value | Kill Point Values (KP) |
   | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
   | 1         | 12          | 1 Point Per KP         |
   | 2         | 9           |                        |
   | 3         | 7           |                        |
   | 4         | 5           |                        |
   | 5         | 4           |                        |
   | 6         | 3           |                        |
   | 7         | 3           |                        |
   | 8         | 2           |                        |
   | 9         | 2           |                        |
   | 10        | 2           |                        |

   | 15        | 1           |                        |
   | 16        | 0           |                        |
   | 17        | 0           |                        |
   | 18        | 0           |                        |
   | 19        | 0           |                        |
   | 20        | 0           |                        |

If a Team misses a match (no Competitors from the Team competed in the match), then the Team receives a Match Score of zero (0) for that match.

At the end of each round or match series, a Team’s total points will include the Team’s Match Scores for all matches in that round or match series (“Round Score”).

Reporting the score will be distinct to clarify point totals. Each report will separate Placement Points and KP.

After the completion of the 6th week series, all week point totals will be tallied and the State Qualifier seeding will be based on Team Score ranked highest to lowest. Once seeding is finalized, all team point totals will be reset to 0 and Advanced Starting Points will be rewarded.

In the event there is a tie, Tie break will be determined as Highest Average Placement Points > Highest Total Kills > Best Placements Total.

#### Advanced Starting Points

* 1st - 4th seed = 5
* 5th - 8th seed = 3
