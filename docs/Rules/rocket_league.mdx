## 4. Stoppage of Play

* Shortly after a pause is initiated, a reason must be given to the IEA representative acting as a referee for the match (e.g.: player disconnect, ping issues, technical difficulties, etc.)
* Each team will have 5 cumulative minutes to pause. When 5 minutes have been exhausted, teams are required to continue playing. Both teams should consider keeping track of time.
* Each team is responsible for timing their pause (any issues should be discussed with  the other team and IEA Administrators)
* In the case of a player disconnect, after the 5 minutes are used, the team must continue the game (2 v 3)
* If the player is able to reconnect, the player can rejoin the match.
* No subs are allowed to be subbed in the middle of a game

## 5. Coaching

* Coaches: Coaches are allowed as long as they are registered as a coach on the team. Coaches are not permitted to play.
* Coaches are not allowed to talk during active play while the game clock is running.
* Coaches are only permitted to talk
  * Before first kickoff
  * During “Goal Replay”
  * After match once post game screen is shown
  * Between games
* Coaches are permitted to be un-deafened in voice chat, but mic must be software muted.

## 6. BM/Toxicity

* Our organization takes any forms of BM or toxicity seriously. Players should imagine that collegiate and professional recruiters may watch your game play at any time. Any form of BM or toxicity will not be tolerated and may result in warnings, player ban, team ban, and team removal from the season with no refunds. This includes but is not limited to:
  * Spamming quick chat lines
  * Using quick chat lines in a toxic manner ("Nice shot!" after a miss, "What a save!" after a goal, etc.)
  * Cursing in game chat
  * Cursing in voice chat
  * Use of any slurs or derogatory language in game chat, LeagueOS chat, or any other form of communication

We are here to have fun and compete in a friendly environment. Please keep that in mind when playing in our league. While we understand that not all schools can stream or record, we do ask for some kind of evidence if a report is made. It is hard to take action without evidence to point to.
